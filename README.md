# External Resources

In addition to the class lectures and powerpoints, I consulted a few external resources for this project:
- http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/warp/warp.htm, for implementing a perturbed FBM function.
- https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58a1bc3c3e00be6bfe6c228c/t/58a4d25146c3c4233fb15cc2/1487196929690/ImplicitProceduralPlanetGeneration-Report.pdf, for inspiration.
